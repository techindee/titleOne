        <h1>Title I Virtual Literacy Night</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Independence Public Schools Virtual Title I Literacy Night. In lieu of an in-person Title I event we have decided the best way to protect the health of our students, family and staff is to hold this event virtually.  This event will open up starting Friday, June 4, 2021. This event is not a live event and can be participated at any time.   
        </p>
        <p>
          Title I offers support to eligible children in the elementary grades. Specific and direct supplemental reading instruction in the skill areas of phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension is offered to students in small group settings. Reading specialists work directly with students to strengthen their reading skills and support children as they become proficient independent readers. Parents/guardians are encouraged to become involved. This promotes positive communication between the home and school and training opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that you are going to love the videos that we have produced for this event. We are excited at the opportunity to promote literacy within the Independence community. Please watch the videos and follow along in the activities that being demonstrated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we have included a survey would like to hear your feedback.  This is important to us so we can take that information and improve this event and future events for you and your family. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you enjoy our Virtual Literacy Night and hope that can take away some ideas on how to promote reading with your family. Thank you for taking time to share this time with your children. 
        </p>
